# v0.0.1

- Moved GoMLX's `backends/simplego` to `gobackend`.
- Removed all dependencies to `stretchr/testify` and `gomlx`, to trim as much as possible external dependencies.
- Moved `gobackend` generic tests to `support/backendtest`, so they can be used by other backends.
- Package `gobackend`:
  - Fixed definition of `Bitcast` when casting to a larger target dtype: the rank is shrinked by 1.
